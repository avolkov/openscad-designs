Overview
========

Bike rack holder adapter for Marin Ignacio and Axiom slim rack.

This will work for anyone tired of buying aluminium connectors that inevitably break. I tried a version that is much smaller and didn't have smooth bends, it lasted at least one season of riding.

Learning from the failures I made this version slightly thicker with smooth curves instead of cylindrical joints.

To not over-tighten the bolts as the adapter will eventually crack.
